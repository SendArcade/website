    description:
    `The first-ever community chess game on Twitter/X, powered by Solana Blinks.

    Each player makes a move as Black or White.
    Play with SOL; if your team wins, earn SEND. 

    CheckMate is a variation designed to make chess community-driven, fun, and rewarding –– made possible with Blinks and cNFTs!

    1️⃣ Check the latest game state and check whether it's Black's or White's turn to play through.

    2️⃣ The player makes their move by either:
    –– selecting one of the 4 suggested moves, or
    –– entering a custom move in the input box (e.g., F2F3 means moving the piece from F2 to F3).

    3️⃣ The bet amount is calculated based on your side's winning odds.

    Higher winning odds → Higher bet amount.

    Receive an NFT for every move played!

    4️⃣ All pooled funds are distributed to the winning side in $SEND.`,
